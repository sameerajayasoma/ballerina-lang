NAME
    Ballerina push - Upload package to Ballerina Central

SYNOPSIS
    ballerina push <package-name> [--no-build]
    [--repository home]

DESCRIPTION
     Uploads the given package to Ballerina Central 
     (https://central.ballerina.io/) repository. 

     By default, the sources will be built before pushing
     the package to Ballerina Central

     Before you can push, you must enter your Ballerina Central
     access token in Settings.toml in your home repository 
     (<USER_HOME>/.ballerina/). To get your token, register
     on Ballerina Central and visit the user dashboard at 
     https://central.ballerina.io/dashboard.  

     When you push a package to Ballerina Central, the runtime will 
     validate organizations for the user against the org-name defined in 
     your packageâ€™s Ballerina.toml file. Therefore, when you have more 
     than one organization in Ballerina Central, be sure to pick the 
     organization name that you intend to push the package into and 
     set that as org-name in the package Ballerina.toml file. 

OPTIONS
      --no-build
           Skip building before pushing. The sources will not be
           built before pushing to Ballerina Central

      --repository home
           Push the package to the home repository. This is an alias
           to the 'ballerina install' command

EXAMPLES

     $ ballerina push math

     Push math package to Ballerina Central without building it
     $ ballerina push math --no-build

      Push math package to the home repository after building it
      $ ballerina push math --repository home
